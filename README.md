## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I learned A LOT from this challenge. I'm not really good at React, so this challenge was a good practice to boost up my React skills! 
I also use grid-column for the first time, and I'm suprised about how much CSS Grid can do! I learned how to use axios too.

#### UPDATE: I already know how to use local storage, and it works perfectly fine!

### Continued development

I wanna use React JS even more in my upcoming projects. Maybe I should give Angular and Vue a try too. 
Next, I'm planning to build a CRUD App using React

### Useful resources
